We can search documents with a command called `grep`. 

The syntax is: `grep option "pattern" file`

Use the `-c` option to count on how many lines the pattern occurs.

To count on how many lines "hello" occurs in a file called greeting.txt we would write `grep -c "hello" greeting.txt`

ðŸ‘‰ 1) Use grep to count the lines that contain "0" in searchme.txt

ðŸ‘‰ 2) Navigate to the log folder of the number that you get.
