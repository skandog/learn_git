ðŸŽ‰Congratulations!ðŸŽ‰

We can now...
- read the contents of files with `cat`
- print your current working directory with `pwd`
- list the contents of you current directory with `ls`

We've spent enough time in this folder it's time for a change. To change directory (folder), we can use the `cd` command. `cd` followed by a path takes us from where we are to the new location.

Let's have a look at whats in this intriguing TOP_SECRET folder. Seeing as we are in the folder which contains the TOP_SECRET folder, we need only put its name and not the full path.

ðŸ‘‰ 1) ls to list the contents of current folder
ðŸ‘‰ 2) `cd` in the the folder `TOP_SECRET` 
ðŸ‘‰ 3) print your working directory to prove that we've changed folders
ðŸ‘‰ 4) List the contents of that folder
ðŸ‘‰ 5) Print the contents of the file that is spelt wrong for your next instruction
