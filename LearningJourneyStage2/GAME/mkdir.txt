So far we have used these commands:

- `cat`
- `cd`
- `pwd`
- `ls`
- `mv`

Take a moment to remember what each of then do.

We just moved the plans and logs to this folder but we may soon be collecting more evidence. Lets make a folder that we can keep all the interesting things we find in.

The command `mkdir` (make directory) makes us a folder in the current working directory.

ðŸ‘‰ First, type in `mkdir EVIDENCE` to make a folder called EVIDENCE.

ðŸ‘‰ Then, move PLANS_AND_LOGS into EVIDENCE using `mv`

ðŸ‘‰ Finally, read the file touch.txt for your next instruction.
