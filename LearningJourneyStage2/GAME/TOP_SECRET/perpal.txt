Success! âœ…

Well done, you've found the file and printed it but unfortunatley, this file was just a decoy. The real interesting stuff lies in a REALLY secret file.

Files that start with a dot (.) are hidden from a standard `ls` command. You can view all files, including hidden files that start with a dot, by using the option `-a` after you write `ls` like so `ls -a`.

ðŸ‘‰ See if you can find any secret files using `ls -a`. If you find one, print the contents for the next instruction.
