We've just used `mkdir` to make a folder called evidence and have moved PLANS_AND_LOGS into it. Let's now make a file called README.txt so that if anything happens to us, people will know what the folder is for.

To make a file we can use the command `touch` followed by the name of the file so in our case we will write `touch README.txt`.

ðŸ‘‰ Change directory into /EVIDENCE 
ðŸ‘‰ create README.txt
ðŸ‘‰ list contents of /EVIDENCE to prove you have made README.txt

Now that we have made a text file we can add text to it by using the command line text editor `nano`.

`nano README.txt` will open up the editor and you will be able to add text. You can't use your mouse to navigate so you will have to use your keyboard.

ðŸ‘‰ open README.txt in the nano editor
ðŸ‘‰ add a title - "this folder contains selected evidence for use in the investigation"
ðŸ‘‰ save with ctr + o
ðŸ‘‰ press enter to confirm file name
ðŸ‘‰ exit with ctr + x

ðŸ‘‰ navigate to GAME/14-1-10/1900 and read index.txt for your next instruction
