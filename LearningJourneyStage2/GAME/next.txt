It's dark here on the command line, and sometimes disorienting. Luckily there are a couple of commands that can help us out.

To see where we are we can use `pwd` which stands for print working directory. `pwd` prints the path of the current folder you are in.

ðŸ‘‰ 1) Try it! Your path should be something like: Users/me/random-junk/GAME

Now we know where we are, lets see what we can find here. The command `ls`, which stands for list, is used to list the contents of the current folder. 

ðŸ‘‰ 2) Try it! You should be able to see the files and folders that are in the folder GAME.

You can see a few things in the folder and we've already read start.txt and next.txt

ðŸ‘‰ 3) Finally, print the contents of step_3.txt for your next instruction. Can you remember how? (hint: meow...)
